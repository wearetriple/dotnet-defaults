# .editorconfig

To align our coding style we use a `.editorconfig` file that specifies our default coding style. This
file should be put in the root of all of our projects, and should automatically be picked up by IDEs.

Our default .editorconfig can be found here: https://github.com/wearetriple/dotnet-defaults/blob/main/.editorconfig
