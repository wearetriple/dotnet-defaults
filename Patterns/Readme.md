# Readme

Every project must have a README.md in its root, in order to help following developers getting started with the project. It must clearly describe what the project is, how to get it running locally, and what tool dependencies it has. If the project has some special requirements or quircks, the README.md must document those and how to deal with them.

If you encounter a project that has no README.md, your first task is to make one.
A good start would be the template below:

``` markdown
# Project Title

## Overview

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is.

* Explanation of the application and its purpose. Answer the questions:
  * What is the motivation behind the creation of the project? This should explain why the project exists.
  * Why is this project relevant to the user?
  * What purpose does it serve?

## What does it do?

## How do I use it?
