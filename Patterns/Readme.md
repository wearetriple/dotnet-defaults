# Readme

Every project *must* have a README.md in its root, in order to help following developers getting started with the project. It *must* clearly describe what the project is, how to get it running locally, and what tool dependencies it has. If the project has some special requirements or quircks, the README.md *must* document those and how to deal with them. A developer *should* be able to get started with the project without external help.

If you encounter a project that has no README.md, you *must* start with this document.
A good start would be the template below:

``` markdown
# Project Title

## Overview

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains what the project is.

* Explanation of the application and its purpose. Answer the questions:
  * What is the motivation behind the creation of the project? This should explain why the project exists.
  * Why is this project relevant to the user?
