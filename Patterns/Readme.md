# Readme

Every project must have a README.md in its root. It must clearly describe what the project is, how to get it running locally and what tool dependencies it has. If the project has some special requirements or quircks, the README.md must document those and how to deal with them.

If you encounter a project that has no README.md, your first task is to make one.
