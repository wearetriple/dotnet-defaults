# Libs

This folder contains small and useful code that can be used in projects. These things are probably too small for a NuGet package, which also makes them harder to use as they cannot be tweaked for the projects requirements.

DO NOT copy this entire libs folder into a project "because it can be useful" like an uncivilized cargo-cult coder; take only what you need.
